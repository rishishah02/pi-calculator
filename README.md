# pi-calculator
C++ code to approximate the value of Ï€ through the use of Monte Carlo Simulation

The logic is as follows: imagine a circle inscibed in a square. The theory is that the area inside the circle divided by the area of the square is pi/4. 

Proof: 

Area(circle) / Area(square) 

= pi*r^2/(s^2), where s = 2r

= pi*r^2/((2r)^2) 

= pi/4
